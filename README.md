# Camera_Model_Identification
The IEEE Signal Processing Society is challenging you to build an algorithm that identifies which camera model captured an image by using traces intrinsically left in the image. Helping to solve this problem would have a big impact on the verification of evidence used in criminal and civil trials and even news reporting.
